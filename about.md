This blog is a place where I can explore topics that I find fascinating.
I consider it an experiment in process. I suspect
that it will end up being a way for me to get the thoughts that go around and
round in my head out so that I can sleep.

Some of the topics i plan to write about are:
* Software Development
* Science
* Gaming
  * Video Games
  * Board Games
  * Tabletop Games
  * Pen and Paper Role Playing Games
* Weird Sports that I like to Watch
* Anything I Find Interesting

This blog is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com).
