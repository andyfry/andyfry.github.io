I have been thinking about getting a new gaming PC for a while now. It has been a long time since I've had one and even longer since I've had a Windows PC.

For quite a while my gaming has been entirly console based and my computers have all been Macs.

The PC gaming itch has been reawakened mostly from watching twitch and youtube streams of games like <a href="https://www.playbattlegrounds.com">PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS</a>. That is not the type of game that I normally get into. I tend to like single-player rpgs or action games and rarely go in for competitive online games. The few execeptions lately have been <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a> and <a href="https://forhonor.ubisoft.com">For Honor</a>.

I have a 4K tv on my desk that I plan on using as my monitor so whatever I get will need to be beefy to look good on that screen.

I plan on building it myself. I think that is more fun and other than laptops and Macs, I have built all my machines since 1998. Having worked as a PC builder in college, I have built hundreds if not thousands of PCs in my time. I am not worried about actually builing a machine, but there is a lot of research to be done about current technology.

I think I may even go water-cooled, just because I've never done it and it looks like fun. I don't have plans to do a lot of overclocking so it might be overkill. Right now this is all just an idea.
